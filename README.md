# AI Multi-Modal Projects

This repository showcases various AI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Hugging Face. The main components of this project include:

1. **Text-to-Speech Generation**
2. **Text-to-Image Generation**
3. **Text Summarization**

Each of these components demonstrates how to utilize LLMs to generate speech from text, create images from textual descriptions, and summarize lengthy text into concise information.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Text-to-Speech Generation**
This module focuses on converting text input into spoken words. It leverages pre-trained models available on Hugging Face to generate natural and intelligible speech.

### 2. **Text-to-Image Generation**
This component generates images based on textual descriptions using LLMs. The aim is to transform written content into creative visual representations.

### 3. **Text Summarization**
The text summarization module condenses long pieces of text into concise summaries. It uses advanced LLM techniques to extract key points while maintaining the original meaning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face `transformers` library
- `torch` (for model loading and inference)
- Other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file
```
